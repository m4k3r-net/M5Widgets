# M5-SNTP
What happens when you mix my M5 Gallery code with (Espressif's SNTP code)[https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples/protocols/sntp]?

This thing is growing into a life-sucking monster! For no good reason, it now displays a QR Code. Yes. A useless QR Code. But. Imagine you wanted a way to pass the SSID/PWD of your M5Stack acting as a Station. Huh? Maybe that'd be less useless. Pun intended.

• Bug fix.

• Started working on the server code: you can set the interval between frames from a browser.
