# BLE UART Test

This is a very simple sketch that demonstrates BLE<>UART communication. My goal was to be able to communicate with the M5Stack from my phone, in order to communicate via LoRa with other phone-M5Stack pairs.

This just does PING-PONG. The M5Stack repeats the string received via BLE.
